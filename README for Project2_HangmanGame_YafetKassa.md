Greetings to the all the fans, I am back at it with the new code. If you though my calculator was cool, just wait until you see my new decryption Hangman Game. My game greets you by name and tells you the rules to the Hangman Game. The rules are that there are 10 encrypted words, and one is selected at random. You have ten tries to guess all the letters in the word. If you fail you will see a game over message, if you win the game will let you know. When you win the code you guessed will be decrypted into a normal word.

Go Get my code on Github https://github.com/squarefair/Basic-Calculator/blob/master/Project2_HangmanGame_YafetKassa.ipynb


my name on Github is squarefair
